When properly configured,\nthe memory subsystem can deliver maximum memory bandwidth and low memory\nlatency. When the memory subsystem is incorrectly configured, memory bandwidth\navailable to the server can be impacted and overall server performance can be\nreduced.\n\nThis paper explains the concept of balanced memory configurations that yields\nthe highest possible memory bandwidth performance from the AMD EPYC\narchitecture. By increasing the number of populated DIMMs from minimum to\nmaximum, examples of balanced and unbalanced memory configurations are shown\nto illustrate their effect on memory subsystem performance.\n\nThis paper specifically covers the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family (EPYC\n9004), formerly code named ""Genoa"". For other processor families, see the\nBalanced Memory papers section.\n\n## Memory Topology\n\nAccess to the data stored on memory DIMMs is controlled by memory controllers\nwithin the processor. The 4th Gen AMD EPYC family processors have twelve\nUnified Memory Controllers (UMC). Each UMC has one memory channel, and each\nmemory channel supports up to two memory DIMM slots. Note that the previous\ngenerations of AMD EPYC processors support eight memory channels per processor\nsocket. This represents a 50% increase in number of supported memory channels\nper processor with this latest EPYC generation.\n\nLenovo ThinkSystem servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors will support\ntwelve memory channels per socket and one DIMM per channel (1DPC) only. Figure\n1 illustrates the logical view of the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor. Each\nprocessor supports twelve UMCs and twelve DDR channels. Each DDR channel\nsupport one DIMM slot (1DPC).\n\n  \nFigure 1. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – logical view\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the layout of the physical DIMM slots on Lenovo servers\nthat support 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor. As shown, on one side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel G is the closest DIMM slot to\nthe processor socket, followed by channel H, I, J, K. Channel L is the\nfarthest DIMM slot from the processor socket. On the other side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel A is the closest to the\nprocessor socket, and DIMM slot connected to channel F is the farthest from\nthe processor socket.\n\n  \nFigure 2. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – physical DIMM layout view\n\nWe will use both views of the processor to help illustrate the DIMM population\nand memory interleaving for all memory configurations.\n\nTo illustrate various memory topologies for a processor, different memory\nconfigurations will be designated as `L:K:J:I:H:G:A:B:C:D:E:F` where each\nletter indicates the number of memory DIMMs populated on each memory channel.\n\n  * A refers to Memory Channel 3 on UMC3\n  * B refers to Memory Channel 4 on UMC4\n  * C refers to Memory Channel 0 on UMC0\n  * D refers to Memory Channel 5 on UMC5\n  * E refers to Memory Channel 1 on UMC1\n  * F refers to Memory Channel 2 on UMC2\n  * G refers to Memory Channel 9 on UMC9\n  * H refers to Memory Channel 10 on UMC10\n  * I refers to Memory Channel 6 on UMC6\n  * J refers to Memory Channel 11 on UMC11\n  * K refers to Memory Channel 7 on UMC7\n  * L refers to Memory Channel 8 on UMC8\n\nThe order of the DIMM sequence in the notation also maps to the actual\nphysical order sequence of the DIMM slots as shown in figure 2 above.\n\nAs an example, a `1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0` memory configuration has 1 DIMM\npopulated on Memory Channels L, J, H, A, C, and E. Channels K, I, G, B, D, and\nF are left unpopulated.\n\n## Memory Interleaving\n\nThe 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family optimizes memory accesses by creating\ninterleave sets across the memory controllers and memory channels. For\nexample, if two memory channels were populated with the same total memory\ncapacity and the same number of ranks, a 2-channel interleave set is created\nacross the two memory channels.\n\nInterleaving enables higher memory bandwidth by spreading contiguous memory\naccesses across all memory channels in a memory interleave set rather than\nsending all memory accesses to one memory channel. This allows the processors\nto access multiple memory channels simultaneously. In order to form an\ninterleave set, all channels are required to have the same DIMM type, the same\ntotal memory capacity and ranks.\n\nFor EPYC 9004 processors, the number of memory channels in an interleave set\nhas to be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n\nIf one interleave set cannot be formed for a particular memory configuration,\nit is possible to have multiple interleave sets. When this happens, memory\nbandwidth performance is dependent on the specific memory region being\naccessed and how many DIMMs comprise the interleave set. For this reason,\nmemory bandwidth performance on memory configurations with multiple interleave\nsets can be inconsistent. Contiguous memory accesses to a memory region with\nfewer channels in the interleave set will have lower performance compared to\naccesses to a memory region with more channels in the interleave set.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a 2-channel interleave set which results from populating\nidentical memory DIMMs on channel A and channel G. This 2-channel interleave\nset interleaves data line across memory controllers and between memory\nchannels. Consecutive addresses alternate between the two memory controllers.\n\n  \nFigure 3. 2-channel interleave set across 2 memory controllers and between 2\nmemory channels\n\n## Balanced Memory Configurations\n\nBalanced memory configurations enable optimal memory interleaving which\nmaximizes memory bandwidth performance. The basic guidelines for a balanced\nmemory subsystem are as follows:\n\n  1. The number of populated memory channels per socket should be 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n  2. All populated memory channel should have the same memory configuration. Since only 1DPC is supported on Lenovo servers with support for 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, it means all populated memory channels should have identical DIMMs.\n  3. All processor sockets on the same physical server should have the same DIMM configuration.\n  4. All NUMA domains in the same processor socket need to have identical memory configuration. This applies when the processor is set to NPS2 or NPS4 (NPS = Numa node per socket).\n\nWe will refer to the above guidelines as _balanced memory guidelines 1, 2, 3,\nand 4_ throughout this paper.\n\n## Performance Test Benchmark\n\nSTREAM Triad is a simple, synthetic benchmark designed to measure sustainable\nmemory bandwidth throughput. The goal is to measure the highest memory\nbandwidth supported by the system. STREAM Triad will be used to measure the\nsustained memory bandwidth of various memory configurations discussed in this\npaper. Unless otherwise stated, all test configurations were done using 64GB\n2R RDIMMs running at 4800MHz.\n\nAs described in the Memory Interleaving section, it is possible to get\ninconsistent memory bandwidth performance when there are multiple interleave\nsets in a memory configuration. To account for this behavior, we configure\neach test run to make sure the STREAM benchmark accesses the entire memory\naddress map. The reported test result reflects the average memory bandwidth\nperformance for these configurations. In reality, memory bandwidth performance\nin configurations with multiple interleave sets can be unpredictable,\ndepending on which interleave set is being accessed. For this reason, we also\nprovide memory bandwidth measurement for the worst case. This happens when\nmemory in the interleave set with the lowest number of memory channels is\nbeing accessed.\n\n## Supported Memory Configurations\n\nWith 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, the following memory configurations are\nsupported on Lenovo servers.A revised white paper on memory population guidelines has been posted to AMD Developer Central.

When properly configured,\nthe memory subsystem can deliver maximum memory bandwidth and low memory\nlatency. When the memory subsystem is incorrectly configured, memory bandwidth\navailable to the server can be impacted and overall server performance can be\nreduced.\n\nThis paper explains the concept of balanced memory configurations that yields\nthe highest possible memory bandwidth performance from the AMD EPYC\narchitecture. By increasing the number of populated DIMMs from minimum to\nmaximum, examples of balanced and unbalanced memory configurations are shown\nto illustrate their effect on memory subsystem performance.\n\nThis paper specifically covers the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family (EPYC\n9004), formerly code named ""Genoa"". For other processor families, see the\nBalanced Memory papers section.\n\n## Memory Topology\n\nAccess to the data stored on memory DIMMs is controlled by memory controllers\nwithin the processor. The 4th Gen AMD EPYC family processors have twelve\nUnified Memory Controllers (UMC). Each UMC has one memory channel, and each\nmemory channel supports up to two memory DIMM slots. Note that the previous\ngenerations of AMD EPYC processors support eight memory channels per processor\nsocket. This represents a 50% increase in number of supported memory channels\nper processor with this latest EPYC generation.\n\nLenovo ThinkSystem servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors will support\ntwelve memory channels per socket and one DIMM per channel (1DPC) only. Figure\n1 illustrates the logical view of the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor. Each\nprocessor supports twelve UMCs and twelve DDR channels. Each DDR channel\nsupport one DIMM slot (1DPC).\n\n  \nFigure 1. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – logical view\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the layout of the physical DIMM slots on Lenovo servers\nthat support 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor. As shown, on one side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel G is the closest DIMM slot to\nthe processor socket, followed by channel H, I, J, K. Channel L is the\nfarthest DIMM slot from the processor socket. On the other side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel A is the closest to the\nprocessor socket, and DIMM slot connected to channel F is the farthest from\nthe processor socket.\n\n  \nFigure 2. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – physical DIMM layout view\n\nWe will use both views of the processor to help illustrate the DIMM population\nand memory interleaving for all memory configurations.\n\nTo illustrate various memory topologies for a processor, different memory\nconfigurations will be designated as `L:K:J:I:H:G:A:B:C:D:E:F` where each\nletter indicates the number of memory DIMMs populated on each memory channel.\n\n  * A refers to Memory Channel 3 on UMC3\n  * B refers to Memory Channel 4 on UMC4\n  * C refers to Memory Channel 0 on UMC0\n  * D refers to Memory Channel 5 on UMC5\n  * E refers to Memory Channel 1 on UMC1\n  * F refers to Memory Channel 2 on UMC2\n  * G refers to Memory Channel 9 on UMC9\n  * H refers to Memory Channel 10 on UMC10\n  * I refers to Memory Channel 6 on UMC6\n  * J refers to Memory Channel 11 on UMC11\n  * K refers to Memory Channel 7 on UMC7\n  * L refers to Memory Channel 8 on UMC8\n\nThe order of the DIMM sequence in the notation also maps to the actual\nphysical order sequence of the DIMM slots as shown in figure 2 above.\n\nAs an example, a `1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0` memory configuration has 1 DIMM\npopulated on Memory Channels L, J, H, A, C, and E. Channels K, I, G, B, D, and\nF are left unpopulated.\n\n## Memory Interleaving\n\nThe 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family optimizes memory accesses by creating\ninterleave sets across the memory controllers and memory channels. For\nexample, if two memory channels were populated with the same total memory\ncapacity and the same number of ranks, a 2-channel interleave set is created\nacross the two memory channels.\n\nInterleaving enables higher memory bandwidth by spreading contiguous memory\naccesses across all memory channels in a memory interleave set rather than\nsending all memory accesses to one memory channel. This allows the processors\nto access multiple memory channels simultaneously. In order to form an\ninterleave set, all channels are required to have the same DIMM type, the same\ntotal memory capacity and ranks.\n\nFor EPYC 9004 processors, the number of memory channels in an interleave set\nhas to be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n\nIf one interleave set cannot be formed for a particular memory configuration,\nit is possible to have multiple interleave sets. When this happens, memory\nbandwidth performance is dependent on the specific memory region being\naccessed and how many DIMMs comprise the interleave set. For this reason,\nmemory bandwidth performance on memory configurations with multiple interleave\nsets can be inconsistent. Contiguous memory accesses to a memory region with\nfewer channels in the interleave set will have lower performance compared to\naccesses to a memory region with more channels in the interleave set.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a 2-channel interleave set which results from populating\nidentical memory DIMMs on channel A and channel G. This 2-channel interleave\nset interleaves data line across memory controllers and between memory\nchannels. Consecutive addresses alternate between the two memory controllers.\n\n  \nFigure 3. 2-channel interleave set across 2 memory controllers and between 2\nmemory channels\n\n## Balanced Memory Configurations\n\nBalanced memory configurations enable optimal memory interleaving which\nmaximizes memory bandwidth performance. The basic guidelines for a balanced\nmemory subsystem are as follows:\n\n  1. The number of populated memory channels per socket should be 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n  2. All populated memory channel should have the same memory configuration. Since only 1DPC is supported on Lenovo servers with support for 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, it means all populated memory channels should have identical DIMMs.\n  3. All processor sockets on the same physical server should have the same DIMM configuration.\n  4. All NUMA domains in the same processor socket need to have identical memory configuration. This applies when the processor is set to NPS2 or NPS4 (NPS = Numa node per socket).\n\nWe will refer to the above guidelines as _balanced memory guidelines 1, 2, 3,\nand 4_ throughout this paper.\n\n## Performance Test Benchmark\n\nSTREAM Triad is a simple, synthetic benchmark designed to measure sustainable\nmemory bandwidth throughput. The goal is to measure the highest memory\nbandwidth supported by the system. STREAM Triad will be used to measure the\nsustained memory bandwidth of various memory configurations discussed in this\npaper. Unless otherwise stated, all test configurations were done using 64GB\n2R RDIMMs running at 4800MHz.\n\nAs described in the Memory Interleaving section, it is possible to get\ninconsistent memory bandwidth performance when there are multiple interleave\nsets in a memory configuration. To account for this behavior, we configure\neach test run to make sure the STREAM benchmark accesses the entire memory\naddress map. The reported test result reflects the average memory bandwidth\nperformance for these configurations. In reality, memory bandwidth performance\nin configurations with multiple interleave sets can be unpredictable,\ndepending on which interleave set is being accessed. For this reason, we also\nprovide memory bandwidth measurement for the worst case. This happens when\nmemory in the interleave set with the lowest number of memory channels is\nbeing accessed.\n\n## Supported Memory Configurations\n\nWith 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, the following memory configurations are\nsupported on Lenovo servers.AMD EPYC 9004 Genoa Memory Population 12 And 10 Channel Memory.

Systems based on AMD EPYC 9004 processors include up to twelve DDR5 memory \nchannels on each CPU socket. A single-socket or dual-socket platform must therefore have all recommended memory \nchannels populated for optimal performance. Other configurations where all channels are not populated will reduce \nperformance. Please see the latest version of Memory Population Guidelines for AMD Family 19h Models 10h–1Fh for \nadditional guidance. \n\n4.3\n\nJava I/O Intensive Workloads\n\nNUMA Affinity\n\n4.3.1\nThe performance of Java I/O-intensive workloads improves by placing the workload on the same NUMA node that \nconnects to the I/O Device. For example, for a networking intensive operation, place the workload on the socket that the \nNetwork Interface Card (NIC) connects to. Command tools, such as lstopo(hwloc) on Linux, can help determine the \nconnectivity between PCI devices and sockets. lstopo(hwloc) can display how the OS sees NUMA nodes, caches, \ncores, and PCI devices.\n\nIOMMU\n\n4.3.2\nThe Input–Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) connects a Direct Memory Access-capable (DMA- capable) I/O \nbus to the main memory. The IOMMU provides several benefits and is required when using x2APIC, which must be \nenabled when using > 255 processor threads. IOMMU allows operating systems and hypervisors to provide extended \nmemory support and protection for DMA-capable I/O devices as well as device interrupt remapping. Virtualized \nenvironments benefit from enabling this option.\n\nIf you believe the IOMMU is degrading performance, then resolve this based on the OS:\n\n•\n\nLinux OS: Enable IOMMU in BIOS and disable it via OS options (e.g., iommu=pt on the Linux kernel command line). \nAMD has contributed code into the Linux kernel for years. The most recent focus is enabling the “Zen,” “Zen 2,” “Zen \n3,” and “Zen 4” architecture contained in AMD EPYC processors. One area of code contribution focused on optimizing \nthe IOMMU code for AMD EPYC processors, which can directly impact TCP/IP performance in both virtualized and \nbare metal environment. Disabling the IOMMU or setting it to passthrough mode may be needed for high-bandwidth \nNICs, such as 200Gbps Ethernet adapters.\n\n• Windows: Disable IOMMU in BIOS. For Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022, please refer to the latest versions of \n\nboth the Microsoft® Windows® Server Tuning guide for AMD EPYC 9004 Series Processors (available from AMD EPYC \nTuning Guides) and the AMD I/O Virtualization Technology (IOMMU) Specification (login required).\n\n58016 – 1.3\n\n23\n\n\x0cJava® Tuning Guide for AMD EPYC™ 9004 Processors\n\nPreferred I/O and PCIe Relaxed Ordering\n\n4.3.3\n3rd Gen and prior AMD EPYC processors included the Preferred I/O and Relaxed Ordering settings that helped optimize \nnetwork and disk I/O performance. 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors (9xx4 models) include architectural enhancements \nthat deliver optimal network and disk I/O performance by default without the need for either of these features.\n\nJumbo Frames\n\n4.3.4\nA jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame with a payload greater than the standard Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of \n1,500 bytes. Enabling jumbo frames in network-intensive deployments may significantly reduce interrupts and system \nCPU utilization and improve performance.\n\n24\n\n58016 – 1.3\n\n\x0cChapter\n5\n\nJava Performance Tuning and \nBest Practices\n\nJava application performance in production environments depends on many factors such as application architecture, \nbottlenecks, oversubscription of the resources, network and storage I/O, memory capacity or bandwidth, OS, Java \nDevelopment Kit (JDK), and parameters. It is also very important to configure hardware platforms to match the \napplication architecture and allow it to scale under various load conditions to meet the deployment’s Service Level \nAgreement (SLA) requirements.\n\nAMD EPYC platforms deliver excellent performance across a wide range of applications. Achieving full Java application \nperformance requires using recommended OS versions, JDK versions, and configuring your platform to match your \napplication needs. Based on the extensive SPECjbb2015 testing, various sections are sharing the details and guidance \nwhich are relevant for many use cases and can easily be applied to the platform under evaluation or in production. If \nmain goal is to replicate a published AMD EPYC platforms SPECjbb2015 result, it can be found by a search at \nSPECjbb2015 Results -- Query* and as per SPECjbb2015 run and reporting rules, each result contains all the setup and \nconfiguration information. Remaining sections in this guide outlines software and Java VM configuration options that \naffect application performance including tuning the operating system and kernel parameters for optimizing Java \napplication performance\n\nOS Configuration and Kernel Parameters\n\n5.1\nAMD recommends using the latest OS version available. Several kernel parameters work well with Java applications. For \nexample, a Java application running large number of threads may benefit from avoiding too many context switches. See \n“Additional Information” on page 37 for information about optimal parameters for SPECjbb2015 performance. I/O-\nintensive applications must have sufficient resources for sockets and file handles. Networking best practices must also \nbe followed. AMD recommends using simple monitoring tools such as vmstat or perfmon to correlate system resource \nutilization against expected performance.\n\nSystem Configuration\n\n5.2\nMost production deployments have very complex system configurations depending on the platforms and applications. \nThis section lists some of the OS settings that boost SPECjbb2015 performance. SPECjbb2015 stresses a system by \nincreasing load in 1% increments of the expected High Bound load until the system reaches maximum sustained \ncapacity while measuring various response times, including the 99th percentile response time. This section presents the \nsystem configurations based on the published results at SPECjbb2015 Benchmark Results* for systems powered by AMD \nEPYC 9004 Series Processors. Using these settings and adjusting for different environments may be appropriate for \nmany typical Java deployments.

When properly configured,\nthe memory subsystem can deliver maximum memory bandwidth and low memory\nlatency. When the memory subsystem is incorrectly configured, memory bandwidth\navailable to the server can be impacted and overall server performance can be\nreduced.\n\nThis paper explains the concept of balanced memory configurations that yields\nthe highest possible memory bandwidth performance from the AMD EPYC\narchitecture. By increasing the number of populated DIMMs from minimum to\nmaximum, examples of balanced and unbalanced memory configurations are shown\nto illustrate their effect on memory subsystem performance.\n\nThis paper specifically covers the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family (EPYC\n9004), formerly code named ""Genoa"". For other processor families, see the\nBalanced Memory papers section.\n\n## Memory Topology\n\nAccess to the data stored on memory DIMMs is controlled by memory controllers\nwithin the processor. The 4th Gen AMD EPYC family processors have twelve\nUnified Memory Controllers (UMC). Each UMC has one memory channel, and each\nmemory channel supports up to two memory DIMM slots. Note that the previous\ngenerations of AMD EPYC processors support eight memory channels per processor\nsocket. This represents a 50% increase in number of supported memory channels\nper processor with this latest EPYC generation.\n\nLenovo ThinkSystem servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors will support\ntwelve memory channels per socket and one DIMM per channel (1DPC) only. Figure\n1 illustrates the logical view of the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor. Each\nprocessor supports twelve UMCs and twelve DDR channels. Each DDR channel\nsupport one DIMM slot (1DPC).\n\n  \nFigure 1. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – logical view\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the layout of the physical DIMM slots on Lenovo servers\nthat support 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor. As shown, on one side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel G is the closest DIMM slot to\nthe processor socket, followed by channel H, I, J, K. Channel L is the\nfarthest DIMM slot from the processor socket. On the other side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel A is the closest to the\nprocessor socket, and DIMM slot connected to channel F is the farthest from\nthe processor socket.\n\n  \nFigure 2. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – physical DIMM layout view\n\nWe will use both views of the processor to help illustrate the DIMM population\nand memory interleaving for all memory configurations.\n\nTo illustrate various memory topologies for a processor, different memory\nconfigurations will be designated as `L:K:J:I:H:G:A:B:C:D:E:F` where each\nletter indicates the number of memory DIMMs populated on each memory channel.\n\n  * A refers to Memory Channel 3 on UMC3\n  * B refers to Memory Channel 4 on UMC4\n  * C refers to Memory Channel 0 on UMC0\n  * D refers to Memory Channel 5 on UMC5\n  * E refers to Memory Channel 1 on UMC1\n  * F refers to Memory Channel 2 on UMC2\n  * G refers to Memory Channel 9 on UMC9\n  * H refers to Memory Channel 10 on UMC10\n  * I refers to Memory Channel 6 on UMC6\n  * J refers to Memory Channel 11 on UMC11\n  * K refers to Memory Channel 7 on UMC7\n  * L refers to Memory Channel 8 on UMC8\n\nThe order of the DIMM sequence in the notation also maps to the actual\nphysical order sequence of the DIMM slots as shown in figure 2 above.\n\nAs an example, a `1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0` memory configuration has 1 DIMM\npopulated on Memory Channels L, J, H, A, C, and E. Channels K, I, G, B, D, and\nF are left unpopulated.\n\n## Memory Interleaving\n\nThe 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family optimizes memory accesses by creating\ninterleave sets across the memory controllers and memory channels. For\nexample, if two memory channels were populated with the same total memory\ncapacity and the same number of ranks, a 2-channel interleave set is created\nacross the two memory channels.\n\nInterleaving enables higher memory bandwidth by spreading contiguous memory\naccesses across all memory channels in a memory interleave set rather than\nsending all memory accesses to one memory channel. This allows the processors\nto access multiple memory channels simultaneously. In order to form an\ninterleave set, all channels are required to have the same DIMM type, the same\ntotal memory capacity and ranks.\n\nFor EPYC 9004 processors, the number of memory channels in an interleave set\nhas to be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n\nIf one interleave set cannot be formed for a particular memory configuration,\nit is possible to have multiple interleave sets. When this happens, memory\nbandwidth performance is dependent on the specific memory region being\naccessed and how many DIMMs comprise the interleave set. For this reason,\nmemory bandwidth performance on memory configurations with multiple interleave\nsets can be inconsistent. Contiguous memory accesses to a memory region with\nfewer channels in the interleave set will have lower performance compared to\naccesses to a memory region with more channels in the interleave set.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a 2-channel interleave set which results from populating\nidentical memory DIMMs on channel A and channel G. This 2-channel interleave\nset interleaves data line across memory controllers and between memory\nchannels. Consecutive addresses alternate between the two memory controllers.\n\n  \nFigure 3. 2-channel interleave set across 2 memory controllers and between 2\nmemory channels\n\n## Balanced Memory Configurations\n\nBalanced memory configurations enable optimal memory interleaving which\nmaximizes memory bandwidth performance. The basic guidelines for a balanced\nmemory subsystem are as follows:\n\n  1. The number of populated memory channels per socket should be 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n  2. All populated memory channel should have the same memory configuration. Since only 1DPC is supported on Lenovo servers with support for 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, it means all populated memory channels should have identical DIMMs.\n  3. All processor sockets on the same physical server should have the same DIMM configuration.\n  4. All NUMA domains in the same processor socket need to have identical memory configuration. This applies when the processor is set to NPS2 or NPS4 (NPS = Numa node per socket).\n\nWe will refer to the above guidelines as _balanced memory guidelines 1, 2, 3,\nand 4_ throughout this paper.\n\n## Performance Test Benchmark\n\nSTREAM Triad is a simple, synthetic benchmark designed to measure sustainable\nmemory bandwidth throughput. The goal is to measure the highest memory\nbandwidth supported by the system. STREAM Triad will be used to measure the\nsustained memory bandwidth of various memory configurations discussed in this\npaper. Unless otherwise stated, all test configurations were done using 64GB\n2R RDIMMs running at 4800MHz.\n\nAs described in the Memory Interleaving section, it is possible to get\ninconsistent memory bandwidth performance when there are multiple interleave\nsets in a memory configuration. To account for this behavior, we configure\neach test run to make sure the STREAM benchmark accesses the entire memory\naddress map. The reported test result reflects the average memory bandwidth\nperformance for these configurations. In reality, memory bandwidth performance\nin configurations with multiple interleave sets can be unpredictable,\ndepending on which interleave set is being accessed. For this reason, we also\nprovide memory bandwidth measurement for the worst case. This happens when\nmemory in the interleave set with the lowest number of memory channels is\nbeing accessed.\n\n## Supported Memory Configurations\n\nWith 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, the following memory configurations are\nsupported on Lenovo servers.Read about server memory population rules and best practices for the HPE ProLiant Gen11 servers with AMD EPYC 9004 series processors in this technical white paper.P0\n\nChapter 4: Hardware Configuration Best Practices\n\nDfPstate index to set below when APBDIS [1]. \n• Min Value: 0 (default) \n• Max Value: 4 \n•\n•\n\nP0: Highest-performing AMD Infinity Fabric P-state \nPn: Next-highest-performing AMD Infinity Fabric P-state \n\nTable 4-2: Recommended advanced BIOS settings (Continued)\n\nMemory Configuration and DIMMs Population\n\n4.2\nIt is very important to ensure that your memory subsystem is properly configured because it plays a crucial role in \nthroughput and response time.

The IOMMU provides several benefits and is required when using x2APIC, which must be \nenabled when using > 255 processor threads. IOMMU allows operating systems and hypervisors to provide extended \nmemory support and protection for DMA-capable I/O devices as well as device interrupt remapping. Virtualized \nenvironments benefit from enabling this option.\n\nIf you believe the IOMMU is degrading performance, then resolve this based on the OS:\n\n•\n\nLinux OS: Enable IOMMU in BIOS and disable it via OS options (e.g., iommu=pt on the Linux kernel command line). \nAMD has contributed code into the Linux kernel for years. The most recent focus is enabling the “Zen,” “Zen 2,” “Zen \n3,” and “Zen 4” architecture contained in AMD EPYC processors. One area of code contribution focused on optimizing \nthe IOMMU code for AMD EPYC processors, which can directly impact TCP/IP performance in both virtualized and \nbare metal environment. Disabling the IOMMU or setting it to passthrough mode may be needed for high-bandwidth \nNICs, such as 200Gbps Ethernet adapters.\n\n• Windows: Disable IOMMU in BIOS. For Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022, please refer to the latest versions of \n\nboth the Microsoft® Windows® Server Tuning guide for AMD EPYC 9004 Series Processors (available from AMD EPYC \nTuning Guides) and the AMD I/O Virtualization Technology (IOMMU) Specification (login required).\n\n58016 – 1.3\n\n23\n\n\x0cJava® Tuning Guide for AMD EPYC™ 9004 Processors\n\nPreferred I/O and PCIe Relaxed Ordering\n\n4.3.3\n3rd Gen and prior AMD EPYC processors included the Preferred I/O and Relaxed Ordering settings that helped optimize \nnetwork and disk I/O performance. 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors (9xx4 models) include architectural enhancements \nthat deliver optimal network and disk I/O performance by default without the need for either of these features.\n\nJumbo Frames\n\n4.3.4\nA jumbo frame is an Ethernet frame with a payload greater than the standard Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of \n1,500 bytes. Enabling jumbo frames in network-intensive deployments may significantly reduce interrupts and system \nCPU utilization and improve performance.\n\n24\n\n58016 – 1.3\n\n\x0cChapter\n5\n\nJava Performance Tuning and \nBest Practices\n\nJava application performance in production environments depends on many factors such as application architecture, \nbottlenecks, oversubscription of the resources, network and storage I/O, memory capacity or bandwidth, OS, Java \nDevelopment Kit (JDK), and parameters. It is also very important to configure hardware platforms to match the \napplication architecture and allow it to scale under various load conditions to meet the deployment’s Service Level \nAgreement (SLA) requirements.\n\nAMD EPYC platforms deliver excellent performance across a wide range of applications. Achieving full Java application \nperformance requires using recommended OS versions, JDK versions, and configuring your platform to match your \napplication needs. Based on the extensive SPECjbb2015 testing, various sections are sharing the details and guidance \nwhich are relevant for many use cases and can easily be applied to the platform under evaluation or in production. If \nmain goal is to replicate a published AMD EPYC platforms SPECjbb2015 result, it can be found by a search at \nSPECjbb2015 Results -- Query* and as per SPECjbb2015 run and reporting rules, each result contains all the setup and \nconfiguration information. Remaining sections in this guide outlines software and Java VM configuration options that \naffect application performance including tuning the operating system and kernel parameters for optimizing Java \napplication performance\n\nOS Configuration and Kernel Parameters\n\n5.1\nAMD recommends using the latest OS version available. Several kernel parameters work well with Java applications. For \nexample, a Java application running large number of threads may benefit from avoiding too many context switches. See \n“Additional Information” on page 37 for information about optimal parameters for SPECjbb2015 performance. I/O-\nintensive applications must have sufficient resources for sockets and file handles. Networking best practices must also \nbe followed. AMD recommends using simple monitoring tools such as vmstat or perfmon to correlate system resource \nutilization against expected performance.\n\nSystem Configuration\n\n5.2\nMost production deployments have very complex system configurations depending on the platforms and applications. \nThis section lists some of the OS settings that boost SPECjbb2015 performance. SPECjbb2015 stresses a system by \nincreasing load in 1% increments of the expected High Bound load until the system reaches maximum sustained \ncapacity while measuring various response times, including the 99th percentile response time. This section presents the \nsystem configurations based on the published results at SPECjbb2015 Benchmark Results* for systems powered by AMD \nEPYC 9004 Series Processors. Using these settings and adjusting for different environments may be appropriate for \nmany typical Java deployments. Please also see “Additional Information” on page 37 for more parameter information.\n\ncpupower -c all frequency-set -g performance\ntuned-adm profile throughput-performance\necho 10000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_cfs_bandwidth_slice_us\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_child_runs_first\necho 16000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_latency_ns\necho 1000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_migration_cost_ns\necho 28000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_min_granularity_ns\necho 9 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_nr_migrate\necho 100 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rr_timeslice_ms\n\n58016 – 1.3\n\n25\n\n\x0cJava® Tuning Guide for AMD EPYC™ 9004 Processors\n\necho 1000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_period_us\necho 990000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_rt_runtime_us\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_schedstats\necho 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_tunable_scaling\necho 50000000 > /proc/sys/kernel/sched_wakeup_granularity_ns\necho 3000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_expire_centisecs\necho 500 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs\necho 40 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_ratio\necho 10 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_background_ratio\necho 10 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness\necho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/numa_balancing\necho always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag\necho always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled\n\n# Add this line to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT # in /etc/default/grub\n\ncgroup_disable=memory,cpu,cpuacct,blkio,hugetlb,pids,cpuset,perf_even \nt,freezer,devices,net_cls,net_prio\n\n# And generate new grub using:(this requires a reboot to take effect) grub2-mkconfig -o /\nboot/grub2/grub.cfg\n\nulimit -n 1024000\necho UserTasksMax=970000 >> /etc/systemd/logind.conf\necho DefaultTasksMax=970000 >> /etc/systemd/system.conf\n\nJava Virtual Machine (JVM)\n\nThis paper provides performance-optimized memory configuration recommendations\nfor different requirements based on the number of DIMMs per socket.\nRecommendations include the mixed capacity DIMMs configuration for the 4th Gen\nAMD EPYC processors.\n\nThis paper is suitable for customers and business partners and sellers who\nwish to understand how to maximize memory performance with Lenovo ThinkSystem\nV3 servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe memory subsystem is a key component of AMD EPYC server architecture which\ncan greatly affect the overall server performance. When properly configured,\nthe memory subsystem can deliver maximum memory bandwidth and low memory\nlatency. When the memory subsystem is incorrectly configured, memory bandwidth\navailable to the server can be impacted and overall server performance can be\nreduced.\n\nThis paper explains the concept of balanced memory configurations that yields\nthe highest possible memory bandwidth performance from the AMD EPYC\narchitecture. By increasing the number of populated DIMMs from minimum to\nmaximum, examples of balanced and unbalanced memory configurations are shown\nto illustrate their effect on memory subsystem performance.\n\nThis paper specifically covers the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family (EPYC\n9004), formerly code named ""Genoa"". For other processor families, see the\nBalanced Memory papers section.\n\n## Memory Topology\n\nAccess to the data stored on memory DIMMs is controlled by memory controllers\nwithin the processor. The 4th Gen AMD EPYC family processors have twelve\nUnified Memory Controllers (UMC). Each UMC has one memory channel, and each\nmemory channel supports up to two memory DIMM slots. Note that the previous\ngenerations of AMD EPYC processors support eight memory channels per processor\nsocket. This represents a 50% increase in number of supported memory channels\nper processor with this latest EPYC generation.\n\nLenovo ThinkSystem servers with 4th Gen AMD EPYC processors will support\ntwelve memory channels per socket and one DIMM per channel (1DPC) only. Figure\n1 illustrates the logical view of the 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor. Each\nprocessor supports twelve UMCs and twelve DDR channels. Each DDR channel\nsupport one DIMM slot (1DPC).\n\n  \nFigure 1. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – logical view\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the layout of the physical DIMM slots on Lenovo servers\nthat support 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor. As shown, on one side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel G is the closest DIMM slot to\nthe processor socket, followed by channel H, I, J, K. Channel L is the\nfarthest DIMM slot from the processor socket. On the other side of the\nprocessor socket, DIMM slot connected to channel A is the closest to the\nprocessor socket, and DIMM slot connected to channel F is the farthest from\nthe processor socket.\n\n  \nFigure 2. 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processor – physical DIMM layout view\n\nWe will use both views of the processor to help illustrate the DIMM population\nand memory interleaving for all memory configurations.\n\nTo illustrate various memory topologies for a processor, different memory\nconfigurations will be designated as `L:K:J:I:H:G:A:B:C:D:E:F` where each\nletter indicates the number of memory DIMMs populated on each memory channel.\n\n  * A refers to Memory Channel 3 on UMC3\n  * B refers to Memory Channel 4 on UMC4\n  * C refers to Memory Channel 0 on UMC0\n  * D refers to Memory Channel 5 on UMC5\n  * E refers to Memory Channel 1 on UMC1\n  * F refers to Memory Channel 2 on UMC2\n  * G refers to Memory Channel 9 on UMC9\n  * H refers to Memory Channel 10 on UMC10\n  * I refers to Memory Channel 6 on UMC6\n  * J refers to Memory Channel 11 on UMC11\n  * K refers to Memory Channel 7 on UMC7\n  * L refers to Memory Channel 8 on UMC8\n\nThe order of the DIMM sequence in the notation also maps to the actual\nphysical order sequence of the DIMM slots as shown in figure 2 above.\n\nAs an example, a `1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0:1:0` memory configuration has 1 DIMM\npopulated on Memory Channels L, J, H, A, C, and E. Channels K, I, G, B, D, and\nF are left unpopulated.\n\n## Memory Interleaving\n\nThe 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor family optimizes memory accesses by creating\ninterleave sets across the memory controllers and memory channels. For\nexample, if two memory channels were populated with the same total memory\ncapacity and the same number of ranks, a 2-channel interleave set is created\nacross the two memory channels.\n\nInterleaving enables higher memory bandwidth by spreading contiguous memory\naccesses across all memory channels in a memory interleave set rather than\nsending all memory accesses to one memory channel. This allows the processors\nto access multiple memory channels simultaneously. In order to form an\ninterleave set, all channels are required to have the same DIMM type, the same\ntotal memory capacity and ranks.\n\nFor EPYC 9004 processors, the number of memory channels in an interleave set\nhas to be 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n\nIf one interleave set cannot be formed for a particular memory configuration,\nit is possible to have multiple interleave sets. When this happens, memory\nbandwidth performance is dependent on the specific memory region being\naccessed and how many DIMMs comprise the interleave set. For this reason,\nmemory bandwidth performance on memory configurations with multiple interleave\nsets can be inconsistent. Contiguous memory accesses to a memory region with\nfewer channels in the interleave set will have lower performance compared to\naccesses to a memory region with more channels in the interleave set.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates a 2-channel interleave set which results from populating\nidentical memory DIMMs on channel A and channel G. This 2-channel interleave\nset interleaves data line across memory controllers and between memory\nchannels. Consecutive addresses alternate between the two memory controllers.\n\n  \nFigure 3. 2-channel interleave set across 2 memory controllers and between 2\nmemory channels\n\n## Balanced Memory Configurations\n\nBalanced memory configurations enable optimal memory interleaving which\nmaximizes memory bandwidth performance. The basic guidelines for a balanced\nmemory subsystem are as follows:\n\n  1. The number of populated memory channels per socket should be 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n  2. All populated memory channel should have the same memory configuration. Since only 1DPC is supported on Lenovo servers with support for 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, it means all populated memory channels should have identical DIMMs.\n  3. All processor sockets on the same physical server should have the same DIMM configuration.\n  4. All NUMA domains in the same processor socket need to have identical memory configuration. This applies when the processor is set to NPS2 or NPS4 (NPS = Numa node per socket).\n\nWe will refer to the above guidelines as _balanced memory guidelines 1, 2, 3,\nand 4_ throughout this paper.\n\n## Performance Test Benchmark\n\nSTREAM Triad is a simple, synthetic benchmark designed to measure sustainable\nmemory bandwidth throughput. The goal is to measure the highest memory\nbandwidth supported by the system. STREAM Triad will be used to measure the\nsustained memory bandwidth of various memory configurations discussed in this\npaper. Unless otherwise stated, all test configurations were done using 64GB\n2R RDIMMs running at 4800MHz.\n\nAs described in the Memory Interleaving section, it is possible to get\ninconsistent memory bandwidth performance when there are multiple interleave\nsets in a memory configuration. To account for this behavior, we configure\neach test run to make sure the STREAM benchmark accesses the entire memory\naddress map. The reported test result reflects the average memory bandwidth\nperformance for these configurations. In reality, memory bandwidth performance\nin configurations with multiple interleave sets can be unpredictable,\ndepending on which interleave set is being accessed. For this reason, we also\nprovide memory bandwidth measurement for the worst case. This happens when\nmemory in the interleave set with the lowest number of memory channels is\nbeing accessed.\n\n## Supported Memory Configurations\n\nWith 4th Gen AMD EPYC Processors, the following memory configurations are\nsupported on Lenovo servers.1.1 Memory Topology. Each 4th Gen AMD EPYC processor (9004 Series) includes 12 Unified Memory Controllers (UMC). Each UMC controls a single memory channel, and each channel can be populated with either 1 or 2 DIMMs, as described above. The tables and images in this User Guide are examples for reference purposes only.', 'question': 'AMD Epic 9004 series memory population recommendation.'}","{'output': 'The AMD EPYC 9004 series processors include up to twelve DDR5 memory channels per CPU socket, and it is highly recommended to populate all memory channels for optimal performance. This ensures maximum memory bandwidth and reduces the likelihood of performance degradation. Here are the key points regarding memory population for the AMD EPYC 9004 series:\n\n1. **Optimal Performance**: All memory channels should be populated for optimal performance. Not populating all channels will result in reduced performance.\n2. **Balanced Memory Configuration**: \n   - The number of populated memory channels per socket should be 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12.\n   - All populated memory channels should have the same memory configuration, with identical DIMMs.\n   - All processor sockets on the same physical server should have the same DIMM configuration.\n   - All NUMA domains in the same processor socket should have identical memory configurations if the processor is set to NPS2 or NPS4 (NPS = Numa node per socket).\n3. **Interleaving**: Memory interleaving enables higher memory bandwidth by spreading memory accesses across all memory channels in an interleave set.

While the EPYC 7003 brings additional performance capability, the \nmemory subsystem is similar to EPYC 7002, apart from a new 6-way interleave mode. EPYC \n7003 processors have been designed to be a drop-in upgrade to EPYC 7002 systems with Type-1 \nenhanced motherboards. However, systems with Type-0 motherboards cannot be upgraded to use \nEPYC 7003. Supported DIMM types include registered DIMMs (RDIMMs) built with x4 and x8 \ndevices, load-reduced DIMMs (LRDIMMs) built with dual die and stacked packages, three-\ndimensional stacked DIMMs (3DS DIMMs), and non-volatile DIMMs (NVDIMMs, type N \nonly). \n\nTable 1.

While the EPYC 7003 brings additional performance capability, the \nmemory subsystem is similar to EPYC 7002, apart from a new 6-way interleave mode. EPYC \n7003 processors have been designed to be a drop-in upgrade to EPYC 7002 systems with Type-1 \nenhanced motherboards. However, systems with Type-0 motherboards cannot be upgraded to use \nEPYC 7003. Supported DIMM types include registered DIMMs (RDIMMs) built with x4 and x8 \ndevices, load-reduced DIMMs (LRDIMMs) built with dual die and stacked packages, three-\ndimensional stacked DIMMs (3DS DIMMs), and non-volatile DIMMs (NVDIMMs, type N \nonly). \n\nTable 1.

Wilson • Nov 15, 2022 02:13 AM EST\n\n• Copy Shortlink\n\nThe latest update to AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler v 4.0 \'AOCC\', offers\nincreased performance across Zen 4 Ryzen & EPYC CPUs. The update was launched\nalongside the 4th Gen EPYC Genoa CPUs last week.\n\n## Benchmarks comparing the AMD AOCC 4.0 and LLVM/Clang compiler library are\nput to the test on Zen 4 powered Ryzen & EPYC CPUs\n\nThe new AOCC 4.0 presents the Zen 4 ""zenver4"" optimizations and further\nsupport for the latest architecture. AOCC 4.0 is not open-source. It is a\nderivative of the LLVM/Clang compiler library and is considered exclusive to\nAMD Zen 4.\n\n##### **Related Story** AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D Drop Down To An Unbelievable Price\nof $278 US: 12-Cores With 3D V-Cache\n\nMichael Larabel of Phoronix compared the two compiler libraries with his AMD\nRyzen 9 7950X processor to determine the performance differences between the\ntwo libraries. His motherboard was the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero with 32GB\nof memory. The environment that he used was Ubuntu 22.10. He does mention that\nonce the GCC 13 is available in March or April 2023, he will revisit this test\nto determine what will be best for Linux users for performance.\n\n**AMD AOCC 4.0 Benchmarks (Image Credits: Phoronix):**\n\n2 of 9\n\nAOCC 4.0 showed significant gains in several benchmarks, albeit mild. The\ntests where the AOCC 4.0 produced slightly better results were in the:\n\n  * **LeelaChessZero 0.28 (both BLAS and Eigen backends)**\n  * **Xmrig 6.18.1**\n  * **Zstd Compression 1.5.0 (both compressed and decompressed)**\n  * **WebP Image Encode 1.2.4 (highest compression and standard and lossless modes)**\n  * **GraphicsMagick 1.3.38 (sharpened and enhanced)**\n  * **Kvazaar 2.1 (4K resolution with both ""very fast"" and ""ultra-fast"" presets)**\n  * **SVT-AV1 1.2 (4K resolution)**\n  * **SVT-HEVC 1.5.0 (4K resolution)**\n  * **x265 3.4 (4K resolution)**\n  * **libavif avifenc 0.11**\n  * **Liquid-DSP 2021.01.31 (16 and 32 threads)**\n  * **ASTC Encoder 4.0 (medium and thorough presets)**\n\nLarabel notes that there was a majority of minimally increased performance\nthrough the testing, with only a few having a significant gain in the\nbenchmarks. He also shares a statement from AMD:\n\n> _...additional GCC 13 optimizatiohn proposals for the Zen4 archjitecture are\n> underway as is our common practice for each Zen generation._\n\nThe author is also slightly surprised at AMD\'s behavior when working on the\nAOCC 4.0 compiler. The company chose to hold off the release of the AOCC 4.0\nuntil after the official launch of new EPYC processors. He feels that\npremature optimization and support would have faired better for the company\nand Linux users with the support. Once better support is introduced in the\nseries, he plans to revisit the benchmarks to see if the AOCC 4.0 compiler is\nstill the choice over LLVM/Clang support.\n\nNews Source: Phoronix\n\nShare this story\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n### Deal of the Day\n\n### Further Reading\n\n  * #### AMD Strix Halo APU Details Leak: Twice As Big As Strix Point, Powerful RDNA 3.5 iGPU, Up To 120W TDP, Coming To ASUS ROG Flow Z13 In 2025\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 9000 ""Zen 5"" Desktop CPU Prices Confirmed: 9950X $599, 9900X $449, 9700X $359, 9600X $279\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 5000XT AM4 CPUs Launched: Ryzen 9 5900XT For $349 & Ryzen 7 5800XT For $249\n\n  * #### AMD Grows Data Center Revenue By 115% As AI Products Take Hold In Market\n\n### Comments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D Drop Down To An Unbelievable Price of $278 US: 12-Cores With 3D V-Cache\n\n56 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Intel In Big Trouble, Class Action Lawsuit For 14th & 13th Gen CPU Instability Issues Begin\n\n42 Active Readers\n\n  * #### DRAM Prices Will Increase Up To 53% In 2024 & Another 35% in 2025 As Memory Industry Delivers Record Revenue Growth\n\n41 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Star Wars Outlaws PC System Requirements Revealed; RTX 4080, RX 7900 XTX Recommended For 4K@60FPS\n\n39 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Unreal Engine 5 Continues to Prove Extremely Demanding on Consoles With Marvel Rivals; Xbox Series S Resolution Drops as Low as 540p\n\n36 Active Readers\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * #### Intel Plans To Layoff ""Thousands of Employees"" Amid Restructuring Policy & Loomy Quarterly Financial Report\n\n2693 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Launches Fluid Motion Frames 2 With AI Optimization, Performance Enhancements, Low-Latency Frame-Gen, RX 6000 & RX 7000 GPU Support\n\n2240 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 7 9700X & Ryzen 5 9600X ""Zen 5"" CPUs Tested At Both Default & PBO Configs, 2% Uplift in Cyberpunk\n\n1939 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Denies Possibility of 14th & 13th Gen CPU Recall Amid Heightened Consumer Woes From Instability Issues, 65W & Above CPUs Affected\n\n1641 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Core Ultra 200K ""Arrow Lake"" CPU Clocks Revealed: Ultra 9 285K 5.7 GHz, Ultra 7 265K 5.5 GHz, Ultra 5 245K 5.2 GHz\n\n1574 Comments\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your\ninbox\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n###### Follow us on\n\nFacebook Youtube Twitter\n\n###### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n###### Sections\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Videos\n  * How To\'s\n  * Analysis\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Appeal Moderation\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Programming Environment / Basic Porting\n\n3.1. Available Compilers\n\nAll compilers that run under x86-64 will normally run on the EPYC processor. However, not all compilers can\ngenerate optimal code for this processor. Some might just produce a smallest possible common subset of instruc-\ntions, using x86 instructions and not even attempt to use the vector units. This varies from compiler to compiler\nand is both vendor and version dependent. There are obvious candidates, the Intel compiler cannot be expected to\nsupport the EPYC processor for natural reasons. On the other hand GNU compilers might do a good job optimizing\nand generating code for the EPYC. Other compilers like Open64 might also do a decent job.\n\nCompilers installed and tested:\n\n• AOCC/LLVM compiler suite, cc, fortran(version 1.0 and 1.2.1)\n\n• GNU compiler suite, gcc, gfortran, g++(version 7.2.0 and 8.1.0)\n\n• Intel compiler suite (Commercial) , icc, ifortran, icpc (version 2018.1)\n\n• Portland Group (PGI) compiler suite (Commercial), pgcc, pgfortran, pgCC (version 17.10)\n\nAMD support the development of a compiler set using LLVM [11]. Using the C and C++ is rather straightforward,\nit installs with a simple script. Using the AOCC and related Fortran plugin is not as easy, it requires some manual\nsteps and configuration and some extra packages. Presently AOCC require a specific version of gcc (4.8.2). This\ncomes bundled with the package.\n\nAOCC/LLVM Intel, PGI (Portland), LLVM and GNU have been tested.\n\n3.1.1. Compiler Flags\n\n3.1.1.1. Intel\n\nThe Intel compiler is developed and targeted for the Intel hardware and hence it has some minor issues when using\nit with AMD hardware.\n\nTable 3. Suggested compiler flags for Intel compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nIntel C compiler\n\nIntel C++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\nIntel Fortran compiler\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -align array64byte -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\nThe  flag  ""march=core-avx2""  is  used  to  force  the  compiler  to  build  AVX2  code  using  the  AVX2  instructions\navailable in EPYC. The generated assembly code does indeed contain AVX (AVX and AVX2) instructions which\ncan be verified by searching for instructions that use the ""ymm"" registers. The documentation states about the ""-\nmarch"" flag ""generate code exclusively for a given <cpu>"" It might not be totally safe to use this on none Intel\nprocessors.\n\nAMD claims that the EPYC processor fully supports AVX2, so it should be safe. Using the ""-xCORE-AVX2""\ncan also be tried, but it might fail in some cases. In addition this might change from version to version of the\nIntel compiler. The only sure way is testing it by trial and error. To illustrate this point, in some cases like the\nHPCG (an alternative top500 test) benchmark, the option ""-march=broadwell"" worked well, e.g. produced the\nbest performing code.\n\nIf on the other side the peak performance is not paramount the safe option would be to use the ""-axHost"" flag\nwhich also generates a least common denominator code which will run on any x86-64 processor. The run time\nsystem performs checks at program launch to decide which code should be executed.\n\n9\n\n\x0cBest Practice Guide - AMD EPYC\n\nWhen operating an a mixed GNU g++ and Intel C++ environment the flags controlling C++ standard are important.\nThe flag ""-std=gnu++98"" is needed to build the HPCG benchmark and in other cases newer standards like ""gnu\n++14"" are needed.\n\n3.1.1.2. PGI\n\nTable 4. Suggested compiler flags for PGI compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nPGI C compiler\n\nPGI C++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\nPGI Fortran compiler\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\nPGI C++ uses gcc version to set the different C++ versions. The installed versions support C++14 and older.\nOnline documentation is available [39].\n\nAnalysis of the generated code shows that using the SIMD option as suggested does generate 256 bits wide vector\ninstructions and that the call for Zen architecture also triggers generation of 256 bits wide FMA and other vector\ninstructions.\n\n3.1.1.3. GNU\n\nTable 5. Suggested compiler flags for GNU compilers\n\nCompiler\n\ngcc compiler\n\ng++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\ngfortran compiler\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n3.1.1.4. AOCC\n\nTable 6. Suggested compiler flags for AOCC compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nclang compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mfma -fvectorize -mfma -mavx2 -\nm3dnow -floop-unswitch-aggressive -fuse-ld=lld\n\nclang++ compiler\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mfma -fvectorize -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fuse-ld=lld\n\nFortran dragonegg/clang\ncompiler\n\n-O3 -mavx -fplugin-arg-dragonegg-llvm-codegen-op-\ntimize=3 -fplugin-arg-dragonegg-llvm-ir-optimize=3\n\nThe clang compiler is under development with assistance from AMD. The fortran front end is based on gcc 4.8.2\nand hence does not have flags for the Zen architecture, alternatives do exist and the documents referenced below\nprovide  more  information.  The  options  may  change,  more  information  about  the  usage  of  the  clang  compiler\nis available online [40]. For the Dragonegg Fortran compiler online documentation is also available [41]. This\ncompiler suite is under heavy development and subject to change. It\'s require some manual extra work to install.\nBut at the time of writing this guide it was not a streamlined product (version 1.0 of AOCC). Please visit the AMD\ndeveloper site to obtain the latest information and releases.\n\nThe Zen architecture in the EPYC processor does no longer support FMA4. However, sources claim it still is\navailable and works, See [12]. However, it might suddenly just vanish, so any usage of the flag -mfma4 should\nbe avoided.\n\n10\n\n\x0cBest Practice Guide - AMD EPYC\n\n3.1.2. Compiler Performance\n\n3.1.2.1. NPB OpenMP version\n\nThe well-known set of benchmarks found in the NPB [49] suite is used for several examples in this guide. The\nperformance numbers are in flops numbers, hence higher is better. The different compilers show varying perfor-\nmance with the different NPB benchmarks. The figure below shows the performance recorded using the OpenMP\nversion of the NPB benchmarks. The OpenMP version is chosen over MPI as the OpenMP thread library is an\nintegral part of the compiler and should be evaluated together with the code generation. The different tests in the\nNPB benchmark suite check both the Fortran and C implementations. Review the benchmark\'s documentations\nfor details. From the figure below it\'s evident that all the tested compilers do a fairly good job.\n\nFigure 5. Compiler performance comparison\n\nThe log scale is used because the different benchmark metrics cover a rather large range. Log scale is used to\ncover all the benchmarks is one figure. It show that there is some variance in the compiler performance. Hence\nit\'s worth the effort to test a few compilers with your application.\n\n3.1.2.2. High Performance Conjugate Gradients benchmark, OpenMP version\n\nThe High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) benchmark [47] is gaining more and more interest because\nthe Linpack (HPL) benchmark used to assess the 500 fastest systems in the world has some shortcomings [48].\nHPCG generally yields a very low processor efficiency due to the fact that this benchmark is highly memory bound.', 'question': 'Which GCC compiler to use with AMD API 4th Gen.'}","{'output': 'Based on the given context, you should use GCC version 13.1 or later for AMD 4th Gen EPYC Series CPUs. This version fully supports the ""Zen 4"" architecture, which is essential for optimizing performance on these processors.'}"

Local memory \nshould provide the lowest access latency. \n\nThe new AMD Secure Memory Encryption feature could cause a small latency increase.  \nDisable if low latency is of higher priority than the new increased security.  \n\nVirtualization Options \n\nIf your application scenario does not require virtualization, then disable AMD Virtualization \nTechnology. With virtualization disabled, also, disable AMD IOMMU. It can cause differences \nin latency for memory access. Finally, also disable SR-IOV.  \n\nCore Performance Boost \n\nCore Performance Boost can cause jitter due to frequency transitions of the processor cores.  \nDisable AMD Core Performance Boost.  Verify CPB is disabled by checking bit 25 = 1 of \nMSRC001_0015 [Hardware Configuration] (HWCR) with rdmsr 0xc0010015. \n\nACPI \n\nThe ACPI SLIT table provides the relative latencies between nodes. Enable this feature so the \ninformation can be used by the Linux scheduler. \n\nDisable the ACPI Watchdog Timer to remove a source of interrupts if you do not need the \nautomatic reset feature in case of an overflow. \n\nMemory Proximity Reporting for IO \n\nEnable Memory Proximity Reporting for IO. This feature reports the proximity relationship \nbetween IO devices and system memory to the operating system. \n\nC-States \n\nC-States can be a source of jitter during the process of state transition.  Disable all c-states. \n\nBIOS Configuration \n\n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\x0cPerformance Tuning Guidelines for Low Latency \nResponse on AMD EPYC™-Based Servers \nApplication Note \n\nOperating System Configuration \n\n56263  Rev. 3.01  June 2018  \n\nOptional Use of the Red Hat Enterprise 7 Real Time Kernel \n\nConsider using the RHEL 7 real time kernel when the latency requirements are below 10 \nmicroseconds. This kernel has been especially tuned for low latency deterministic response. \n\nThe real time kernel can be installed with the following commands: \n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4/7.5  \n\nHowever, assuming the user does not want to use anything but the standard RHEL 7.4 kernel, the \nremaining tuning tips are illustrated with a two socket AMD EPYC™-based system with the \nstandard kernel installed.  \n\nNote:  The 10 µs target was achieved with the standard kernel using the following tuning tips.  \n\nThe /proc filesystem \n\nThe /proc filesystem interface can expose information on a per process level, or the internal \nkernel data and the kernel subsystems, and system devices.  A few examples of reading kernel \ninformation are shown below. \n\nEnter the following command to verify the running kernel: \n\n12 \n\nOperating System Configuration \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c56263  Rev. 3.01  June 2018 \n\nPerformance Tuning Guidelines for Low Latency \nResponse on AMD EPYC™-Based Servers \nApplication Note"", 'question': 'Is there any 4th Gen. tuning guide for AMD for networking?'}","{'output': 'Yes, the context provided includes a tuning guide specifically for the 4th Generation AMD EPYC™ 9004 Series Processors for Java® applications.

Today, ICs are used in virtually all products involving electronics,\nincluding PCs and related peripherals, voice and data communications and\nnetworking products, facsimile and photocopy machines, home entertainment\nequipment, industrial control equipment and automobiles. The market for ICs\ncan be divided into separate markets for digital and analog devices. AMD\nparticipates primarily in the market for digital ICs. The three principal\ntypes of digital ICs used in most electronic systems are: (i) microprocessors,\n(ii) memory circuits and (iii) logic circuits. Microprocessors are used for\ncontrol and computing tasks, memory circuits are used to store data and\nprogramming instructions, and logic circuits are employed to manage the\ninterchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. AMD designs,\nmanufactures and sells each of the three principal types of digital ICs\nthrough, collectively, its Computation Products Group (""CPG""), its\nCommunications Group, its Memory Group and its programmable logic device\nsubsidiary, Vantis Corporation (""Vantis""). CPG products ($682 million, or 29\npercent, of the Company\'s 1997 net sales) include microprocessors and core\nlogic products, with the majority of CPG\'s net sales being derived from\nMicrosoft Windows compatible S-3 microprocessors which are used primarily in\nPCs. In the second quarter of 1997, AMD introduced the AMD-K6(R)\nmicroprocessor, a sixth-generation microprocessor product and a member of the\nK86(TM) microprocessor family, and has shipped over three million units to\ndate. Eight of 1996\'s top 20 PC vendors worldwide, including Compaq and IBM,\ncurrently offer AMD-K6 based systems. The Company plans to introduce new\nversions of the AMD-K6 with features such as enhanced 3D graphics capabilities\nand is also devoting substantial resources to the development of its seventh-\ngeneration Microsoft Windows compatible microprocessor. Communications Group\nproducts ($707 million, or 30 percent, of the Company\'s 1997 net sales)\ninclude telecommunication, networking and embedded processor products. The\nCompany\'s telecommunications products are used in equipment such as central\n\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Programming Environment / Basic Porting\n\n3.1. Available Compilers\n\nAll compilers that run under x86-64 will normally run on the EPYC processor. However, not all compilers can\ngenerate optimal code for this processor. Some might just produce a smallest possible common subset of instruc-\ntions, using x86 instructions and not even attempt to use the vector units. This varies from compiler to compiler\nand is both vendor and version dependent. There are obvious candidates, the Intel compiler cannot be expected to\nsupport the EPYC processor for natural reasons. On the other hand GNU compilers might do a good job optimizing\nand generating code for the EPYC. Other compilers like Open64 might also do a decent job.\n\nCompilers installed and tested:\n\n• AOCC/LLVM compiler suite, cc, fortran(version 1.0 and 1.2.1)\n\n• GNU compiler suite, gcc, gfortran, g++(version 7.2.0 and 8.1.0)\n\n• Intel compiler suite (Commercial) , icc, ifortran, icpc (version 2018.1)\n\n• Portland Group (PGI) compiler suite (Commercial), pgcc, pgfortran, pgCC (version 17.10)\n\nAMD support the development of a compiler set using LLVM [11]. Using the C and C++ is rather straightforward,\nit installs with a simple script. Using the AOCC and related Fortran plugin is not as easy, it requires some manual\nsteps and configuration and some extra packages. Presently AOCC require a specific version of gcc (4.8.2). This\ncomes bundled with the package.\n\nAOCC/LLVM Intel, PGI (Portland), LLVM and GNU have been tested.\n\n3.1.1. Compiler Flags\n\n3.1.1.1. Intel\n\nThe Intel compiler is developed and targeted for the Intel hardware and hence it has some minor issues when using\nit with AMD hardware.\n\nTable 3. Suggested compiler flags for Intel compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nIntel C compiler\n\nIntel C++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\nIntel Fortran compiler\n\n-O3 -march=core-avx2 -align array64byte -fma -ftz -fomit-frame-pointer\n\nThe  flag  ""march=core-avx2""  is  used  to  force  the  compiler  to  build  AVX2  code  using  the  AVX2  instructions\navailable in EPYC. The generated assembly code does indeed contain AVX (AVX and AVX2) instructions which\ncan be verified by searching for instructions that use the ""ymm"" registers. The documentation states about the ""-\nmarch"" flag ""generate code exclusively for a given <cpu>"" It might not be totally safe to use this on none Intel\nprocessors.\n\nAMD claims that the EPYC processor fully supports AVX2, so it should be safe. Using the ""-xCORE-AVX2""\ncan also be tried, but it might fail in some cases. In addition this might change from version to version of the\nIntel compiler. The only sure way is testing it by trial and error. To illustrate this point, in some cases like the\nHPCG (an alternative top500 test) benchmark, the option ""-march=broadwell"" worked well, e.g. produced the\nbest performing code.\n\nIf on the other side the peak performance is not paramount the safe option would be to use the ""-axHost"" flag\nwhich also generates a least common denominator code which will run on any x86-64 processor. The run time\nsystem performs checks at program launch to decide which code should be executed.\n\n9\n\n\x0cBest Practice Guide - AMD EPYC\n\nWhen operating an a mixed GNU g++ and Intel C++ environment the flags controlling C++ standard are important.\nThe flag ""-std=gnu++98"" is needed to build the HPCG benchmark and in other cases newer standards like ""gnu\n++14"" are needed.\n\n3.1.1.2. PGI\n\nTable 4. Suggested compiler flags for PGI compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nPGI C compiler\n\nPGI C++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\nPGI Fortran compiler\n\n-O3 -tp zen -Mvect=simd -Mcache_align -Mprefetch -Munroll\n\nPGI C++ uses gcc version to set the different C++ versions. The installed versions support C++14 and older.\nOnline documentation is available [39].\n\nAnalysis of the generated code shows that using the SIMD option as suggested does generate 256 bits wide vector\ninstructions and that the call for Zen architecture also triggers generation of 256 bits wide FMA and other vector\ninstructions.\n\n3.1.1.3. GNU\n\nTable 5. Suggested compiler flags for GNU compilers\n\nCompiler\n\ngcc compiler\n\ng++ compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\ngfortran compiler\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mtune=znver1 -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fomit-frame-pointer\n\n3.1.1.4. AOCC\n\nTable 6. Suggested compiler flags for AOCC compilers\n\nCompiler\n\nclang compiler\n\nSuggested flags\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mfma -fvectorize -mfma -mavx2 -\nm3dnow -floop-unswitch-aggressive -fuse-ld=lld\n\nclang++ compiler\n\n-O3 -march=znver1 -mfma -fvectorize -mfma -mavx2 -m3dnow -fuse-ld=lld\n\nFortran dragonegg/clang\ncompiler\n\n-O3 -mavx -fplugin-arg-dragonegg-llvm-codegen-op-\ntimize=3 -fplugin-arg-dragonegg-llvm-ir-optimize=3\n\nThe clang compiler is under development with assistance from AMD. The fortran front end is based on gcc 4.8.2\nand hence does not have flags for the Zen architecture, alternatives do exist and the documents referenced below\nprovide  more  information.  The  options  may  change,  more  information  about  the  usage  of  the  clang  compiler\nis available online [40]. For the Dragonegg Fortran compiler online documentation is also available [41]. This\ncompiler suite is under heavy development and subject to change. It\'s require some manual extra work to install.\nBut at the time of writing this guide it was not a streamlined product (version 1.0 of AOCC). Please visit the AMD\ndeveloper site to obtain the latest information and releases.\n\nThe Zen architecture in the EPYC processor does no longer support FMA4. However, sources claim it still is\navailable and works, See [12]. However, it might suddenly just vanish, so any usage of the flag -mfma4 should\nbe avoided.\n\n10\n\n\x0cBest Practice Guide - AMD EPYC\n\n3.1.2. Compiler Performance\n\n3.1.2.1. NPB OpenMP version\n\nThe well-known set of benchmarks found in the NPB [49] suite is used for several examples in this guide. The\nperformance numbers are in flops numbers, hence higher is better. The different compilers show varying perfor-\nmance with the different NPB benchmarks. The figure below shows the performance recorded using the OpenMP\nversion of the NPB benchmarks. The OpenMP version is chosen over MPI as the OpenMP thread library is an\nintegral part of the compiler and should be evaluated together with the code generation. The different tests in the\nNPB benchmark suite check both the Fortran and C implementations. Review the benchmark\'s documentations\nfor details. From the figure below it\'s evident that all the tested compilers do a fairly good job.\n\nFigure 5. Compiler performance comparison\n\nThe log scale is used because the different benchmark metrics cover a rather large range. Log scale is used to\ncover all the benchmarks is one figure. It show that there is some variance in the compiler performance. Hence\nit\'s worth the effort to test a few compilers with your application.\n\n3.1.2.2. High Performance Conjugate Gradients benchmark, OpenMP version\n\nThe High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) benchmark [47] is gaining more and more interest because\nthe Linpack (HPL) benchmark used to assess the 500 fastest systems in the world has some shortcomings [48].\nHPCG generally yields a very low processor efficiency due to the fact that this benchmark is highly memory bound.\n\n__ Menu __ News __ Hardware __ Gaming __ Mobile __ Finance __ Software __\nDeals __ Reviews __ Videos __ How To\n\nWccftech\n\nNews Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Software Deals Reviews How To\n\nHardwareLinux\n\n# AMD Optimizing C/C++ Compiler 4.0 \'AOCC\' Makes Zen 4 Ryzen & EPYC CPUs Run\nFaster\n\nJason R.

His motherboard was the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero with 32GB\nof memory. The environment that he used was Ubuntu 22.10. He does mention that\nonce the GCC 13 is available in March or April 2023, he will revisit this test\nto determine what will be best for Linux users for performance.\n\n**AMD AOCC 4.0 Benchmarks (Image Credits: Phoronix):**\n\n2 of 9\n\nAOCC 4.0 showed significant gains in several benchmarks, albeit mild. The\ntests where the AOCC 4.0 produced slightly better results were in the:\n\n  * **LeelaChessZero 0.28 (both BLAS and Eigen backends)**\n  * **Xmrig 6.18.1**\n  * **Zstd Compression 1.5.0 (both compressed and decompressed)**\n  * **WebP Image Encode 1.2.4 (highest compression and standard and lossless modes)**\n  * **GraphicsMagick 1.3.38 (sharpened and enhanced)**\n  * **Kvazaar 2.1 (4K resolution with both ""very fast"" and ""ultra-fast"" presets)**\n  * **SVT-AV1 1.2 (4K resolution)**\n  * **SVT-HEVC 1.5.0 (4K resolution)**\n  * **x265 3.4 (4K resolution)**\n  * **libavif avifenc 0.11**\n  * **Liquid-DSP 2021.01.31 (16 and 32 threads)**\n  * **ASTC Encoder 4.0 (medium and thorough presets)**\n\nLarabel notes that there was a majority of minimally increased performance\nthrough the testing, with only a few having a significant gain in the\nbenchmarks. He also shares a statement from AMD:\n\n> _...additional GCC 13 optimizatiohn proposals for the Zen4 archjitecture are\n> underway as is our common practice for each Zen generation._\n\nThe author is also slightly surprised at AMD\'s behavior when working on the\nAOCC 4.0 compiler. The company chose to hold off the release of the AOCC 4.0\nuntil after the official launch of new EPYC processors. He feels that\npremature optimization and support would have faired better for the company\nand Linux users with the support. Once better support is introduced in the\nseries, he plans to revisit the benchmarks to see if the AOCC 4.0 compiler is\nstill the choice over LLVM/Clang support.\n\nNews Source: Phoronix\n\nShare this story\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\n### Deal of the Day\n\n### Further Reading\n\n  * #### AMD Strix Halo APU Details Leak: Twice As Big As Strix Point, Powerful RDNA 3.5 iGPU, Up To 120W TDP, Coming To ASUS ROG Flow Z13 In 2025\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 9000 ""Zen 5"" Desktop CPU Prices Confirmed: 9950X $599, 9900X $449, 9700X $359, 9600X $279\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 5000XT AM4 CPUs Launched: Ryzen 9 5900XT For $349 & Ryzen 7 5800XT For $249\n\n  * #### AMD Grows Data Center Revenue By 115% As AI Products Take Hold In Market\n\n### Comments\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments.\n\n### Trending Stories\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D Drop Down To An Unbelievable Price of $278 US: 12-Cores With 3D V-Cache\n\n56 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Intel In Big Trouble, Class Action Lawsuit For 14th & 13th Gen CPU Instability Issues Begin\n\n42 Active Readers\n\n  * #### DRAM Prices Will Increase Up To 53% In 2024 & Another 35% in 2025 As Memory Industry Delivers Record Revenue Growth\n\n41 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Star Wars Outlaws PC System Requirements Revealed; RTX 4080, RX 7900 XTX Recommended For 4K@60FPS\n\n39 Active Readers\n\n  * #### Unreal Engine 5 Continues to Prove Extremely Demanding on Consoles With Marvel Rivals; Xbox Series S Resolution Drops as Low as 540p\n\n36 Active Readers\n\n### Popular Discussions\n\n  * #### Intel Plans To Layoff ""Thousands of Employees"" Amid Restructuring Policy & Loomy Quarterly Financial Report\n\n2693 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Launches Fluid Motion Frames 2 With AI Optimization, Performance Enhancements, Low-Latency Frame-Gen, RX 6000 & RX 7000 GPU Support\n\n2240 Comments\n\n  * #### AMD Ryzen 7 9700X & Ryzen 5 9600X ""Zen 5"" CPUs Tested At Both Default & PBO Configs, 2% Uplift in Cyberpunk\n\n1939 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Denies Possibility of 14th & 13th Gen CPU Recall Amid Heightened Consumer Woes From Instability Issues, 65W & Above CPUs Affected\n\n1641 Comments\n\n  * #### Intel Core Ultra 200K ""Arrow Lake"" CPU Clocks Revealed: Ultra 9 285K 5.7 GHz, Ultra 7 265K 5.5 GHz, Ultra 5 245K 5.2 GHz\n\n1574 Comments\n\nSubscribe to get an everyday digest of the latest technology news in your\ninbox\n\nEmail address\n\n\n\n###### Follow us on\n\nFacebook Youtube Twitter\n\n###### Topics\n\n  * Hardware\n  * Gaming\n  * Mobile\n  * Finance\n  * Software\n  * Security\n  * Web\n\n###### Sections\n\n  * Deals\n  * Reviews\n  * Videos\n  * How To\'s\n  * Analysis\n  * Exclusives\n  * Interviews\n\n###### Company\n\n  * About\n  * Advertise with Us\n  * Contact\n  * Tip Us\n  * Careers\n  * Terms of Use\n  * Privacy & Cookie Policy\n  * Ethics Statement\n  * Appeal Moderation\n\nSome posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.

Revenues\nwere $22.7 billion, down four percent year-over-year as revenue growth in our\nEmbedded and Data Center segments was offset by declines in our Client and\nGaming segments. Data Center revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $6.5 billion,\ndriven by higher sales of AMD InstinctTM GPUs and 4th Gen AMD EPYCTM CPUs.\nEmbedded segment revenues increased by 17% to $5.3 billion, primarily driven\nby the full year of revenue associated with the acquisition of Xilinx. Our\nData Center and Embedded segments accounted for more than 50% of total revenue\nduring fiscal 2023. Client segment revenues declined by 25% to $4.7 billion\ndue to weak PC market conditions and inventory correction across the PC supply\nchain that impacted the first half of fiscal 2023. Gaming segment revenue\ndeclined 9% to $6.2 billion, primarily driven by lower semi-custom product\nrevenue.\n\nGross margin for the year was 46% compared to 45% last year, driven primarily\nby growth in our Embedded segment and lower amortization of intangible assets\nassociated with the acquisition of Xilinx. Operating expenses grew 7%,\nreflecting increased R&D expenses supporting our investments in AI. Operating\nincome for 2023 was $401 million compared to operating income of $1.3 billion\nfor 2022. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to lower Client\nsegment performance and increased R&D investments, partially offset by lower\namortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. Net income for 2023 was\n$854 million compared to $1.3 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net\nincome was primarily driven by lower operating income.\n\nCharles M.

The\nCompany\'s products include a wide variety of industry-standard ICs which are\nused in many diverse product applications such as personal computers (""PCs""),\nworkstations, telecommunications equipment, data and network communications\nequipment and consumer electronics. AMD customers include leading electronics\nmanufacturers such as 3Com, Acer, AT&T;, Compaq, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard,\nIBM, Motorola, NEC and Siemens, each of which was among AMD\'s top ten\ncustomers in 1997\\. The IC market has grown dramatically over the past ten\nyears, driven primarily by the demand for electronic business and consumer\nproducts. Today, ICs are used in virtually all products involving electronics,\nincluding PCs and related peripherals, voice and data communications and\nnetworking products, facsimile and photocopy machines, home entertainment\nequipment, industrial control equipment and automobiles. The market for ICs\ncan be divided into separate markets for digital and analog devices. AMD\nparticipates primarily in the market for digital ICs. The three principal\ntypes of digital ICs used in most electronic systems are: (i) microprocessors,\n(ii) memory circuits and (iii) logic circuits. Microprocessors are used for\ncontrol and computing tasks, memory circuits are used to store data and\nprogramming instructions, and logic circuits are employed to manage the\ninterchange and manipulation of digital signals within a system. AMD designs,\nmanufactures and sells each of the three principal types of digital ICs\nthrough, collectively, its Computation Products Group (""CPG""), its\nCommunications Group, its Memory Group and its programmable logic device\nsubsidiary, Vantis Corporation (""Vantis""). CPG products ($682 million, or 29\npercent, of the Company\'s 1997 net sales) include microprocessors and core\nlogic products, with the majority of CPG\'s net sales being derived from\nMicrosoft Windows compatible S-3 microprocessors which are used primarily in\nPCs. In the second quarter of 1997, AMD introduced the AMD-K6(R)\nmicroprocessor, a sixth-generation microprocessor product and a member of the\nK86(TM) microprocessor family, and has shipped over three million units to\ndate. Eight of 1996\'s top 20 PC vendors worldwide, including Compaq and IBM,\ncurrently offer AMD-K6 based systems. The Company plans to introduce new\nversions of the AMD-K6 with features such as enhanced 3D graphics capabilities\nand is also devoting substantial resources to the development of its seventh-\ngeneration Microsoft Windows compatible microprocessor. Communications Group\nproducts ($707 million, or 30 percent, of the Company\'s 1997 net sales)\ninclude telecommunication, networking and embedded processor products. The\nCompany\'s telecommunications products are used in equipment such as central\n\nAbout AMD \nFor 50 years AMD has driven innovation in high-performance \ncomputing, graphics, and visualization technologies—the building \nblocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the data center. \nHundreds of millions of consumers, leading Fortune 500 \nbusinesses, and cutting-edge scientific research facilities around \nthe world rely on AMD technology daily to improve how they live, \nwork, and play. AMD employees around the world are focused on \nbuilding great products that push the boundaries of what is \npossible.

AMD has \nfocused its product development activities on the three areas of its \nbusiness: (1) X86, K86 and other microprocessors and related embedded \nprocessors for personal computers, (2) applications solutions products, and (3) \nhigh-volume commodity products such as programmable logic and non-volatile \nmemory devices. \n\n  Personal computer (""PC"") products include microprocessors and related \nembedded processors used in computers. AMD\'s applications solutions products \nare focused on networks, voice/data communications (World Network), and on \ncomputer peripherals, computer interfaces and mass storage. High-volume \ncommodity products include Flash and programmable logic devices (""PLDs""). PLDs \nand Flash memory devices are typically produced by more than one manufacturer, \nsubject to intense competition, and broadly applicable across a wide customer \n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\x0cbase. Because most of AMD\'s products are utilized in personal computers and \nrelated peripherals, AMD\'s future growth is closely tied to performance of the \nPC industry. \n\n  Product design and development, and wafer fabrication activities are \ncurrently conducted at AMD\'s facilities in California and in Texas. AMD and \nFujitsu Ltd. are parties to a joint venture which has constructed and is \noperating a wafer fabrication facility for the manufacture of Flash memory \ndevices in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan. The joint venture plans to build a second \nwafer fabrication facility adjacent to the existing facility at a planned cost \nof $1.1 billion. A subsidiary of Sony Corporation manufactures bipolar products \nfor the Corporation in San Antonio, Texas. Nearly all product assembly and \nfinal testing are performed at AMD\'s manufacturing facilities in Penang, \nMalaysia; Singapore; and Bangkok, Thailand, or by subcontractors in Asia. A \nlimited amount of testing of products destined for delivery in Europe is \nperformed at AMD\'s facilities in Basingstoke, England. AMD is currently \nplanning to construct a submicron wafer fabrication facility at a site yet to \nbe determined at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion.\n\nAMD began as an alternate-source manufacturer of integrated circuits \noriginally developed by other suppliers and has shifted to proprietary products \n(i.e., products resulting from AMD\'s design or technology innovations).
